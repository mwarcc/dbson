[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Abstract

This repository contains a sophisticated implementation of the Binary JSON (BSON) specification, providing high-performance serialization and deserialization capabilities with comprehensive type support and robust error handling mechanisms. The implementation adheres to the BSON 1.1 specification while introducing optimized memory management and enhanced validation protocols.

## Technical Overview

### Core Components

#### BSONSerializer
Implements an advanced binary serialization algorithm with O(n) complexity, utilizing sophisticated buffer management techniques and supporting the complete BSON type system. The serializer employs a state machine architecture for maintaining contextual integrity during the serialization process.

#### BSONDeserializer
Provides a high-performance deserialization implementation with strict type validation and memory-efficient buffer handling. Utilizes advanced pointer arithmetic for optimal parsing performance.

#### ObjectId
Implements MongoDB's ObjectId specification with cryptographically secure random number generation and monotonic timestamp integration.

### Type System

The implementation supports the following BSON types with their corresponding binary representations:

```
0x01: Double IEEE 754
0x02: UTF-8 string
0x03: Embedded document
0x04: Array
0x05: Binary data
0x06: Undefined (Deprecated)
0x07: ObjectId
0x08: Boolean
0x09: UTC datetime
0x0A: Null
0x0B: Regular Expression
0x0D: JavaScript code
0x0E: Symbol
0x0F: JavaScript code w/ scope
0x10: 32-bit integer
0x11: Timestamp
0x12: 64-bit integer
0x13: 128-bit decimal
```

## Implementation Details

### Memory Management

The implementation utilizes sophisticated buffer management techniques:

- Pre-allocated buffer pools for common operations
- Zero-copy optimization for large binary data
- Efficient memory reuse strategies
- Optimized TypedArray implementations

### Validation Protocol

Implements a multi-layer validation system:

1. Structural integrity verification
2. Recursive depth monitoring
3. Circular reference detection
4. Key namespace validation
5. Type consistency enforcement

### Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Serialize | O(n) | O(n) |
| Deserialize | O(n) | O(n) |
| Validation | O(n) | O(log n) |

Where n represents the number of nodes in the object graph.

## Usage Examples

```javascript
const { BSONSerializer, BSONDeserializer, ObjectId } = require('./dbson');

// Serialization
const document = {
  _id: new ObjectId(),
  timestamp: new Date(),
  data: new Uint8Array([0x62, 0x75, 0x66, 0x66, 0x65, 0x72])
};

const serialized = BSONSerializer.serialize(document);

// Deserialization
const deserialized = BSONDeserializer.deserialize(serialized);
```

## Error Handling

The implementation provides comprehensive error handling through the `BSONError` class, which includes:

- Detailed error codes
- Stack trace preservation
- Contextual error information
- Path tracking for nested errors

## Technical Considerations

### Endianness
All multi-byte numeric types are serialized in little-endian format as per the BSON specification.

### UTF-8 Handling
String encoding/decoding strictly follows UTF-8 specifications with proper surrogate pair handling.

### Binary Subtype Support
Implements all standard binary subtypes (0x00-0x07) and user-defined subtypes (0x80-0xFF).

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

1. Pre-allocate buffers for known document sizes
2. Utilize the streaming API for large documents
3. Implement custom type handlers for specific use cases
4. Consider using the bulk operation API for multiple documents

## Architectural Constraints

- Maximum document depth: 100 levels
- Maximum document size: 16MB
- Key names must not contain '.' or start with '$'
- No circular references allowed
